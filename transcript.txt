Hi, I'm Ohan, and this is my demo for AI Hackfest, hosted by MLH. Every day, visually impaired commuters face challenges navigating transit. We built "Safe Step," a transit companion, which is a voice-powered web app that gives step-by-step directions right from your browser. Safe Step. How do I get to Kenwood Town Center? The app listens, transcribes, and sends requests to Gemini AI. It understands the destination and grabs real-time route information. Each instruction is spoken clearly and shown on screen in large text. You can move step-by-step at your own pace. We are also slowly implementing transit API, which slowly gives instructions to the user about their bus stops and how they can use public transport to get from one place to the other. Starting from 2378 Ravine Street, Cincinnati, OH, 45219, USA. The total journey is 10.7 miles and will take approximately 17 minutes. Here are your step-by-step directions: Step one, step, step. This step is 285 ft long. It will take approximately 1 minute. Step two, step, step is 220 ft long. It will take approximately 1 minute. Turn left. Step three, this step is 1 ft. You have arrived at your destination. 7875 Montgomery Road, Cincinnati, OH, 45236, USA. With Gemini's LLM capabilities to generate real-time transcriptions from audio, transit data from Google Maps Directions API, and OpenAI's LLM to generate real audio feedback for users to be interactive with, our web app helps commuters travel independently, and no app install is needed. Just voice, confidence, and freedom. This app is made for visually impaired individuals, and we hope that it will help them get to their destination as safe as possible and as soon as possible. Thank you.
